# Solution

## Description of the problem

The helloworld challenge requires to develop an app that prints a specific string with a specific verbosity `hello-world-mobisec-edition` and tag `MOBISEC` using Android's Logging API.

## Solution

I've solved the challenge by developing an app doing 

```java
Log.i("MOBISEC","hello-world-mobisec-edition");
```

with Log API in onCreate() event.  


## Optional Feedback

I really liked this challenge because it is an easy helloworld to help me get familiar with Android Studio.
